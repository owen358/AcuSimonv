How Can Cosmetic Acupuncture Help
Me?

Featured on Channel 4 TV series such as '10 Years Younger' and 'How Not to Get Old', a Cosmetic or Facial Acupuncture treatment will concentrate on points and muscles of the face in order to improve elasticity of your skin and general overall appearance.

Acupuncture has been around for thousands of years and although relatively new to the West the Chinese have been using points on the face to combat the signs of ageing and to help with various skin conditions for many years. It was in use as early as the Song Dynasty (960AD - 1279AD) when the Empress and Emperor's concubines received Cosmetic Acupuncture.

So, what kind of results can be achieved? Unlike BOTOXÂ®, which carries a large number of possible side effects, Cosmetic Acupuncture is a totally natural and holistic anti-ageing treatment that aims to reduce fine lines and wrinkles.
<br><br>
Cosmetic Acupuncture, in contrast, will require a course of treatment to show pronounced results. However, the whole face is treated and as body points are also used, a patient's health and wellbeing can be greatly improved by undertaking a series of treatments. Facial patients often report that they feel healthier, sleep better, have brighter eyes and feel more balanced; those are the kind of side effects we like!

The acupuncture points and the way that they are used in a Cosmetic Acupuncture session have all been chosen specifically with this overall achievement of wellbeing in mind.

This treatment also works on lifting the face, particularly where the face begins to sag around the 'jowls' and the cheek area, rather than simply targeting wrinkles.
<br>
Studies published in the International Journal of Clinical Acupuncture in 1996 showed that of 300 people who received Facial Acupuncture, 90% demonstrated marked results after only their first treatment.

Over a course of treatments you can not only expect to be looking more radiant, but you will also start to feel more at balance and happy in yourself. The Irish Times recently acclaimed this treatment as:
<br>
"...a viable alternative to cosmetic surgery and the effects can run much deeper than simply improving appearances."

When you feel more in control of your body, mind and spirit you can then start to address other issues in your life. These are all things that we can achieve when we are in balance and feeling good about ourselves, once you start to feel like this, you will be surprised how much your self image improves. This can be achieved by Cosmetic Acupuncture bringing your natural beauty to the surface.
