La Acupuntura<br>
<br>
Hasta hace algunos años, la alternativa para eliminar las arrugas era el botox, los rellenos, peelings químicos o cirugías
estéticas.<br>
<br>
las agujas causan una contracción de la dermis (o capa interna de la piel), estimulando los nervios apropiados. Estos
causan la contracción, los músculos faciales se recogen y se produce el estiramiento del cutis.<br>
<br>
Las relaciones que establece la MTC en el análisis de la cara<br>
<br>
El estado del pelo esta relacionado con el estado de la Sangre o la esencia de Riñón, el grosor y el brillo del pelo
depende del Pulmón.<br>
<br>
El color de la cara refleja el estado del Qi y de la Sangre.<br>
<br>
El color claro y una apariencia hidratada de la cara indica un Qi de Estómago intacto.
Los distintos colores informan también sobre el estado de los órganos internos, el color amarillo puede indicar una
insuficiencia de Energía del órgano Bazo, por ejemplo.<br>
<br>
Algunas zonas de la cara indican el estado de determinados órganos en función del brillo, del color, etc. Así,
vemos como el rostro puede darnos mucha información sobre el estado de salud de una persona.
La belleza exterior depende del estado energético interior, por esto es necesario concentrar el tratamiento sobre el
equilibrio energético, esto dará resultados duraderos.<br>

NEUROTRANSMISORES<br>
<br>
Arginine plays an important role in cell division, the healing of wounds, removing
ammonia from the body, immune function, and the release of hormones. [2] [7] [8]
<br>
The roles of arginine include:<br>
<br>
Asparagine an amino acid that is used in the biosynthesis of proteins.<br>
<br>
This glycosylation is important both for protein structure and protein function.<br>
<br>
Gamma-Aminobutyric acid(γ-Aminobutyric acid) GABA is the chief inhibitory
neurotransmitter in the mammalian central nervous system. GABA is also directly
responsible for the regulation of muscle tone.<br>
<br>
Glycine is a significant component used in the method of protein analysis. It serves
as a buffering agent, maintaining pH.<br>
<br>
Acetylcholine in the serum exerts a direct effect on vascular tone by binding
to muscarinic receptors present on vascular endothelium. These cells respond by
increasing production of nitric oxide, which signals the surrounding smooth muscle
to relax, leading to vasodilation.<br>
<br>
(Botox) acts by suppressing the release of acetylcholine, whereas the venom from
a black widow spider (alpha-latrotoxin) has the reverse effect. ACh inhibition
causes paralysis. When bitten by a black widow spider, one experiencesBotulinum
toxin the wastage of ACh supplies and the muscles begin to contract. If and when
the supply is depleted, paralysis occurs.<br>
<br>
Dopamine functions primarily as a local chemical messenger. In blood vessels, it
inhibits norepinephrine release and acts as a vasodilator (at normal
concentrations).<br>
<br>
Before the Warring States period of Chinese history (475–221 BC) having acupuncture
treatment for cosmetic concerns was primarily a luxury, generally reserved for the
Empress and the imperial concubines to initiate the healing process for rejuvenation and
longevity as well as health.<br>
<br>
skin colour, texture, complexion, elasticity, sebaceous secretions, and the size and depth
of wrinkles as well as the eyes becoming brighter. Currently you will find a mei
rong department in most hospitals and universities in China<br>

FRA: the effects<br>
<br>
A 1996 report in the International Journal of Clinical Acupuncture reported that among 300
cases treated in China with cosmetic facial acupuncture, 90% had marked effects with one
course of treatment. Effects included: improvement in skin texture and colouring,
increased elasticity, reduction of wrinkles and overall rejuvenation, not merely confined to
the face.<br>
<br>
The effects of FRA vary according to the prior condition and lifestyle of the patient, the
techniques employed by the practitioner as well as the experience and skill level of the
practitioner. FRA may erase as many as five to fifteen years from the face, with some
results apparent as early as the first treatment. The effects of acupuncture being
cumulative, the results continue to progress throughout the course of treatment.
Though not a cure for wrinkles, fine lines may be eliminated while deeper wrinkles tend to
diminish considerably. Other likely results include eyebags being reduced or eliminated,
puffiness of the face reduced or banished, facial colouring equalised (whether too red or
too pale), drooping eyelids lifted, and double chins minimized and in some cases
eliminated. Drooping eyelids and eyebrows, jowls and ‘turkey necks’ can be observed as
having lifted and toned. With the profound increase of local circulation of qi and blood to
the face and stimulation of the movement of lymph, skin texture and colouring improves
visibly, the moisture content of the skin improves, muscle tone improves, and pore size is
reduced. Techniques can also be employed to eliminate broken capillaries. Visible stress
and habitual expressions from the face melt away.<br>
<br>
As with regular acupuncture, the results are manifold and include the improvement of
circulation, digestion and hormonal balance, and empirically have been found to benefit
the hair and the sense organs, thyroid and brain.<br>
<br>
Acupuncture is known to have neuro-endocrine effects and benefit hormones. For many
women oestrogen levels decline with age, accelerating the ageing process of the skin.
Establishing hormonal balance will benefit many aspects of the body, including skin
conditions such as hormonal acne and the dry skin that frequently accompanies
menopause.<br>
<br>
FRA: possible underlying mechanisms<br>
<br>
According to the Nei Jing, the hair and skin, including the complexion, are related to the
state of the internalzang fu organs. The condition of the hair is governed by the kidneys
and the lung rules the skin.<br>
<br>
As the partner of the lung, the large intestine also affects the skin profoundly and thus
many points on the large intestine meridian are used for affecting the skin of the face. The
stomach meridian traverses much of the face and is often used to obtain local cosmetic
effect. The stomach is the interior-exterior partner to the spleen and accordingly these
points help to tone the flesh (the muscles and the fat underlying the skin). This
communication of the lung and the spleen (zang organs) and the stomach and the large
intestine (fuorgans) allows them to act synergistically and to substitute for each other in
their functions. Increased subcutaneous fat is a likely cumulative result of needling
stomach points on the face coupled with tonification of distal spleen points.
One of the many explanations of the various mechanisms by which acupuncture works is
that with needle insertion, the body endures a micro-trauma that in turn stimulates the
injury repair system within the body. It is this natural healing process that stimulates the
production of collagen at the site of the needle insertion. Regeneration of the dermis and
epidermis produces new collagen and elastin proteins. New skin tissue essentially appears
younger.
