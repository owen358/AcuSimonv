<!-- There is constant pressure in todayâ€™s society to achieve a high standard of
beauty.  There is an abundance of chemical products available today that were
not in the past and while making you appear more beautiful in the short term,
actually damages your skin over the long term.  The use of chemical products
on the skin comes with the price of making the skin age quicker. Cosmetic
acupuncture is a natural way to improve your skin not only on the surface but
deep into the skin tissue. <br>

Health-damaging chemicals are so common that they are present in
almost all cosmetics. Many commercial products cause allergies,
pigmentation problems, skin irritation and hormonal disorders. These chemical
additives can be harmful to health in the long term, some of their
ingredients may be carcinogenic and are used by the cosmetic industry only
because they are cheaper and save money.

If most people knew about the long-term effects of the chemical
components used in the production of make-up, creams, deodorants etc
maybe they wouldn't use them as much.<br>
