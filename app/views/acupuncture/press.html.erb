There is constant pressure in today’s society to achieve a high standard of
beauty.  There is an abundance of chemical products available today that were
not in the past and while making you appear more beautiful in the short term,
actually damages your skin over the long term.  The use of chemical products
on the skin comes with the price of making the skin age quicker. Cosmetic
acupuncture is a natural way to improve your skin not only on the surface but
deep into the skin tissue. <br>

Health-damaging chemicals are so common that they are present in
almost all cosmetics. Many commercial products cause allergies,
pigmentation problems, skin irritation and hormonal disorders. These chemical
additives can be harmful to health in the long term, some of their
ingredients may be carcinogenic and are used by the cosmetic industry only
because they are cheaper and save money.

If most people knew about the long-term effects of the chemical
components used in the production of make-up, creams, deodorants etc
maybe they wouldn't use them as much.<br>

The detailed and ancient knowledge of the Chinese forms the basis for acupuncture.
This knowledge was used to develop the concept much further and apply it to the
field of cosmetology with facial acupuncture. Facial acupuncture is a technique
which has an antiaging effect, and offers very similar effects to those achieved
with injections of collagen, hyaluronic acid or botox, for example.<br>
<br>
<h1 class="off">Why is this ancient method becoming such a popular technique?</h1><br>

Beauty treatments are the order of the day and acupuncture can be a great ally to
get the best look. On many occasions it is better than undergoing other treatments
like botox injections or expensive creams that in the end, although they fulfill
their mission, are extremely expensive treatments for many people and can have
side effects.
